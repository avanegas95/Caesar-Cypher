# Caesar Cypher
 Small beginner project to practice logic of lists and loops. This also includes practicing writing README.md files and to gain familiarity and learning how to format this file type.
 
## How to Run
 Download or clone the repository. Navigate to the directory. Execute the "Caesar Cypher.py" file.

## Description
 The program starts off by giving the user the option to 'encode' or 'decode' a word.

 It will then ask the user for the message. It also ask for the 'shift' which can be any integer value.

 **Encode** will shift offset that letter by that set amount to hide the message e.g. 'a' encoded with a shift of 1 will result in it printing b. 'hello' shifted by 5 will result in 'mjqqt'

 **Decode** works in the other direction. It asks for the for the input string and then the shift. Using decode, string input 'mjqqt', and a shift of 5, we receive our original message of 'hello'
